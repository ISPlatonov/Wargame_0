There is a class "Warrior". Two instances of the unit are created from it. Each person is assigned a health of 100 points. They hit each other randomly. The one who hits, health does not lose. The one who is hit, it is reduced by 20 points from one hit. After each hit, you need to display a message, which unit attacked, and how much health the enemy has left. As soon as someone runs out of health resources, the program ends with a message about who won.
